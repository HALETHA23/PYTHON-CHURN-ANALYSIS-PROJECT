# PYTHON-CHURN-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
Telecom Customer Churn Analysis project focuses on identifying key factors driving customer attrition using exploratory data analysis. It analyzes tenure, contracts, services, and payment methods to uncover churn patterns and provides data-driven strategies to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.
Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry to identify the key factors that lead customers to discontinue services. The objective is to move beyond identifying churned customers and instead understand the underlying reasons for churn, enabling the business to take proactive retention measures.

Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to analyze customer behavior, identify high-risk churn segments, and generate actionable insights that help improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

Tools and Technologies

The analysis was performed using data analysis and visualization tools such as Python or SQL for data processing, exploratory data analysis techniques for pattern identification, and business intelligence tools for visualizing insights.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level telecom data including demographic information, tenure, contract types, internet and add-on services, payment methods, and churn status.

Key Insights

Gender does not have a significant impact on churn.
Around 41% of senior citizens churn, making them a high-risk segment.
Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.
Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rates.
Customers without value-added services (online security, backup, device protection, tech support) churn more frequently.
Customers using automatic payment methods churn significantly less than those using manual payment options.

Recommendations
 
Improve onboarding and engagement for new customers.
Design senior-citizen-friendly plans and support services.
Encourage long-term contracts through incentives.
Bundle value-added services to increase perceived value.
Improve service quality for fiber optic customers.
Promote automatic payment methods to reduce churn risk.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data-driven analysis can uncover meaningful insights into customer behavior and support strategic decisions aimed at improving customer retention and long-term business performance.
