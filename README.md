Telecom Customer Churn Analysis project focuses on identifying key factors driving customer attrition using exploratory data analysis. It analyzes tenure, contracts, services, and payment methods to uncover churn patterns and provides data-driven strategies to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.
Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry to identify the key factors that lead customers to discontinue services. The objective is to move beyond identifying churned customers and instead understand the underlying reasons for churn, enabling the business to take proactive retention measures.

Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to analyze customer behavior, identify high-risk churn segments, and generate actionable insights that help improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

Tools and Technologies

The analysis was performed using data analysis and visualization tools such as Python or SQL for data processing, exploratory data analysis techniques for pattern identification, and business intelligence tools for visualizing insights.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level telecom data including demographic information, tenure, contract types, internet and add-on services, payment methods, and churn status.

Key Findings

The analysis shows that gender does not significantly influence churn. Senior citizens exhibit a higher churn rate compared to other customers. Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn, especially during the early stages of the customer lifecycle. Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn, while long-term contracts show better retention. Customers without value-added services such as online security, backup, device protection, and technical support are more likely to churn. Automatic payment methods are associated with lower churn compared to manual payments.

Business Recommendations

To reduce churn, the business should focus on improving early customer engagement, introducing senior-citizen-friendly plans, encouraging long-term contract adoption, bundling value-added services, improving fiber optic service support, and promoting automatic payment methods.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data-driven analysis can uncover meaningful insights into customer behavior and support strategic decisions aimed at improving customer retention and long-term business performance.
